# Tutela

A single-page, mobile-first **bilingual** marketing site for **Tutela** — Quebec
secondary-school **admission-exam tutoring**, run by students who *just passed
those exams*. It exists so parents get a clear, trustworthy picture of the service
(who teaches, what's covered, the price, the dates, how to enrol) and reach out on
WeChat — without the founder answering the same questions over and over.

**Live:** https://tutelamtl.ca — the canonical domain. `webtutela.vercel.app`
serves the same site and should redirect here.

- **Simplified Chinese by default**, with a **中文 / EN** toggle.
- Headlines are **language-aware**: Noto Serif SC for Chinese, Fraunces for English.
- **No backend** — the only contact path is the WeChat QR code.

## Design — "Le Passage"

The whole site is built on one idea: the brand's **pointed arch** is the threshold a
child passes through into secondary school. The hero arch *draws itself* on load
like an architect's blueprint, a small arch crowns every section, and a larger one
bookends the closing CTA. The look is a **printed prospectus crossed with an
architect's drawing** — warm, editorial, restrained.

- **The full design system is in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md)** — hand it to an AI (or a
  designer) before any visual work.
- **The story of how the design evolved is in
  [`docs/DESIGN-JOURNAL.md`](./docs/DESIGN-JOURNAL.md)** — what worked, what didn't, and why.

## What's on the page

Hero (arch + CTA) → then numbered editorial sections:

1. **01 · Credibility** — class-size / subjects / schedule numbers, school names,
   tutor credentials (incl. the named math tutor), and the 24/7 support promise.
2. **02 · Subjects & grades** — Math / French / English, grades 3–5, 1-on-1 & special cases.
3. **03 · How it works** — schedule, online/offline, enrolment steps, and pricing
   ($15 / $30 / **$40 bundle**).
4. **04 · Why students improve** — the teaching philosophy, as a full-bleed deep-green manifesto.
5. **05 · The tutors** — Math (Chen Chen) / English / French credentials.
6. **06 · Key dates** — info session **June 19**, enrolment opens **June 26**.
7. **07 · FAQ** — real parent questions.
8. **Final CTA** — WeChat QR + scan hint + contact (Dennis).

A pinned **announcement ribbon** keeps the two key dates visible at all times.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** — tokens: cream `#faf7f2`, deep-green ink `#1f4733`, terracotta
  accent `#c0532b` (CTA only), warm-charcoal body `#2b2b28`
- Fonts via `next/font`: **Noto Serif SC** (headlines), **Noto Sans SC** (body),
  **Fraunces** (wordmark, section numbers, EN headlines)
- **Lucide** icons (sparingly) · **Vercel Analytics**
- **Vitest** + React Testing Library

All copy lives in **`lib/content.ts`** as `{ zh, en }` pairs (single source of truth);
`lib/LanguageContext.tsx` holds the active locale (zh default, persisted to
`localStorage`, and reflected on `<html lang>`).

## Discoverability & the agent surface

Parents arrive from WeChat and RED; everyone else arrives through a search engine
or an AI assistant. Those readers are served deliberately:

- **The brand name is written in both scripts.** "Tutela" alone is a common Latin
  word, so `Tutela 识途学辅` appears in the page title, the description, the footer
  and the structured data — a search for either half has something of ours to rank.
  Name, area served, format and contact are worded identically in the footer, on
  `/about`, on `/contact` and in the JSON-LD (`components/NapCard.tsx`).
- **`/llms.txt`** (`lib/agent.ts`) says what this site is, **when an agent should
  reach for it**, when it should send someone elsewhere, and how to call it —
  there is no API, and the only contact path is WeChat.
- **Every page has a Markdown twin.** Send `Accept: text/markdown`, or append
  `.md` to any path (`/program.md`, `/index.md`). `middleware.ts` negotiates and
  answers with `Vary: Accept, Accept-Encoding`; `.md` URLs carry `noindex` so they
  can't compete with the canonical HTML.
- **404s are real 404s** with a short Markdown index pointing at the sitemap,
  `llms.txt` and the main sections — never a 200 that tells a crawler every path
  exists.
- **Trust anchors:** `/about`, `/contact` and `/privacy` are the pages an agent
  checks before recommending a business; all three are substantive and bilingual
  (`/privacy` excepted — English only, and `noindex`).
- **Structured data** is one `@graph` (`lib/schema.ts`): an `Organization` /
  `EducationalOrganization` node plus a `WebSite` node, with the guides' `Article`
  data and the FAQ pointing back at the same `@id`.

## Claim-safety (enforced by `__tests__/content.test.ts`)

Some wording is deliberately constrained to stay truthful and verifiable:

- The math tutor's credentials name only the **AMC** and **Waterloo (CEMC)** contests
  (no "#1" superlative); the results are described as publicly verifiable.
- The class **location** is described as *being finalized* — the site never claims
  classes are held at a named school, and implies no institutional affiliation.
- **Mock exams** are framed as *coming soon*, not as a finished product.
- No fabricated stats, testimonials, or photos of real people.

## Deploy

Vercel (`vercel --prod`); production is aliased to **webtutela.vercel.app**.
Commits are attributed to the owner only.

## Before-launch / nice-to-have

- A **custom domain** (e.g. `tutela.ca`).
- A real **parent testimonial** (the slot is designed, just not shown until real).
- Confirm the **info-session location** (currently "确认中 / being finalized").
