              Tutela provides small-group tutoring for Quebec secondary school admission exams
              in the subjects of Math, French, and English, aimed at primary grades 3–5. We
              also offer general academic tutoring for grade 4 and below, focusing on fundamentals,
              habits, and learning interest, as well as 1-on-1 sessions by private arrangement.

            <p>
              Classes are conducted fully online via Zoom according to the schedule of each subject.
